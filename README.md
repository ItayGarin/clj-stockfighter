# clj-stockfighter

## Overview

__clj-stockfighter__ provides an easy-to-use wrapping for [Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io/)'s API.

I've set out to build this in Clojure as a part in my ongoing journey of learning this wonderful language.  
Thus, any feedback and contributions are more than welcome :)

This library uses the MIT license => You can (and should!) go wild with this.

<div id='api-venue-up'/>
### API/Venue Up? (Heartbeat)

This is how you check if Stockfighter's API is up.  
Under the hood, this will perform a simple GET heartbeat request.  

__Reference__ - [API Heartbeat](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/heartbeat)
```Clojure
(api-up?) 
;; => true
```

Similarly, This is how you check if a specific venue is up.  
In this example (and the following ones), I'll be using the "TESTEX" test venue.  
Once again, this will perform a GET heartbeat request.

__Reference__ - [Venue Heartbeat](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/venue-healthcheck)

```Clojure
(defn venue-up? [venue])
;; => true
```

<div id='get-venue-stocks'/>
### Getting The Symbols of a Venue's Stocks

Pretty self-explanatory.  
Simply returns a standard response hash-map with a vector of symbols.

__Reference__ - [Stocks on a Venue](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/list-stocks-on-venue)

```Clojure
(get-venue-stocks "TESTEX")

;; =>
 {:ok true,
 :symbols
 [{:name "Foreign Owned Occluded Bridge Architecture Resources",
   :symbol "FOOBAR"}]}
```

<div id='get-stock-quote'/>
### Getting a Quote for a stock

This returns a quote for a given stock in a venue.


```Clojure
(get-stock-quote "TESTEX" "FOOBAR")

;; =>
{:ok true,
 :venue "TESTEX",
 :symbol "FOOBAR",
 :quoteTime "2015-12-27T17:15:14.300598468Z",
 :lastTrade "2015-12-27T17:14:56.68753119Z",
 :last 50000,    ;; price of the last trade
 :lastSize 1,    ;; quantity of the last trade
 :ask 51000      ;; best price currently offered for the stock
 :askSize 20,    ;; aggregate size of all orders at the best ask
 :askDepth 10,   ;; aggregate size of *all asks*
 :bid 50000      ;; best price currently bid for the stock
 :bidSize 293,   ;; aggregate size of all orders at the best bid
 :bidDepth 766,  ;; aggregate size of *all bids*
 }
```

<div id='get-order-status'/>
### Getting the Orderbook for a stock

There are 3 different methods of obtaining the status of our orders ("Orderbook").
Here are a few examples for these different methods.

__Reference__ - [The Orderbook for a Stock](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/get-orderbook-for-stock)

```Clojure
(def api-key "insert-your-key-here")

;; ex: All orders for a specific stock in an account
(get-account-stock-orders-status api-key "NDMEX" "HB2243235" "FOOBAR") 

;; ex: All orders in an account
(get-account-all-orders-status api-key "NDMEX" "HB2243235") ;; ex: All orders for an account

;; ex: Status for a specific order (based on the order-id)
(get-order-status "my-key" "TESTEX" "FOOBAR" order-id])

;; The output for (get-account-all-orders-status)
;; =>
{:ok true,
 :venue "NDMEX",
 :orders
 [{:open true,
   :symbol "FAC",
   :orderType "limit",
   :totalFilled 0,
   :account "HB2243235",
   :ts "2015-12-27T17:45:16.849640158Z",
   :id 8820,
   :ok true,
   :originalQty 10,
   :venue "NDMEX",
   :qty 10,
   :fills [],
   :price 1000,
   :direction "buy"}]}
```

<div id='post-cancel-order'/>
## Post/Cancel an Order

Here I'll explain how to post a new order and cancel a pending one.  

For convenience purposes the following is a utility function for creating an Order hash-map. 
This hash-map will serve as the argument of the cancel/post functions.

```Clojure
(def my-order
    (make-order "TESTEX" "FOOBAR" "ACCOUNT1234" "buy" 100 5000 "limit"))
;; =>
{:account "ACCOUNT1234",
 :venue "TESTEX",
 :stock "FOOBAR",
 :price 5000,
 :qty 100,
 :direction "buy",
 :orderType "limit"}
```

Once we have the order map, posting it is simple.  
Just give it to the `post-order` function (along with your api-key).


__Reference__ - [A New Order for a Stock](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/place-new-order)

```Clojure
(post-order api-key my-order)
```

The same principle applies to canceling a pending order.  

The only gotcha here is that you have to `assoc` an :id to the order hash-map.
This let's the Stockfighter game-master know which order you're referring to.

__Reference__ - [Cancel An Order](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/cancel-an-order)


```Clojure
;; Notice that we gotta add the :id to the order for canceling!
(cancel-order api-key (assoc my-order :id "13646"))
```

<div id='websocket-api'/>
## Websocket API

Once you feel comfortable with the above API you may want 
to stop polling the server and subscribe to a feed instead.

For that purpose, Stockfigter provides us with the Websocket API.
Here a few examples how to create and utilize these websockets.

Notice, that you don't need to provide an api-key to create these sockets.

__Reference__ - [Quotes (Ticker Tape) Websockets](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/quotes-ticker-tape-websocket)

__Reference__ - [Executions (Fills) Websockets](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/executions-fills-websocket)

```Clojure
(make-venue-tickertape-ws "TESTEX" "FOOBAR")
(make-stock-tickertape-ws "TESTEX" "ACCOUNT1234" "FOOBAR")
(make-venue-fills-ws "TESTEX" "FOOBAR")
(make-stock-fills-ws "TESTEX" "ACCOUNT1234" "FOOBAR")

;; To get a message from a websocket use the take! function manifold provides
(def msg 
    @(manifold.stream/take! websocket))
```

<div id='gamemaster-api'/>
## Game-Master API

The GM API is intended to serve those of you who are -
- Getting tired (like me) of starting, stopping or restarting a level.
- Are too lazy to copy and paste the venue, stock or account strings.

For these purposes, the library provides you with the following easy-to-use functions.  
Please read the reference forum post for more details.

__Reference__ - [The GM API](https://discuss.starfighters.io/t/the-gm-api-how-to-start-stop-restart-resume-trading-levels-automagically/143)

```Clojure
(defn gm-start-level [api-key level])
(defn gm-restart-level [api-key instance])
(defn gm-stop-level [api-key instance])
(defn gm-resume-level [api-key instance])
```
